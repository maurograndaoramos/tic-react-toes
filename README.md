# tic-react-toes
A simple tic-tac-toe app made with React (For learning purposes only)

# These are the steps to follow

## 1. Project Setup

    Initialize your project: Create a new React app using Create React App (CRA). This tool sets up your development environment so you can use the latest JavaScript features, provides a good developer experience, and optimizes your app for production.
    Folder Structure: Organize your project files. You might not need much beyond what CRA provides initially, but as your app grows, consider separating components, styles, and utility functions into different folders.

## 2. Design Phase

    Mockup: Sketch or use a design tool to visualize your game board. It doesn't have to be complex, but having a visual reference will help.
    Decide on Components: Based on your design, decide the components you'll need. For a Tic Tac Toe game, you might have a Board component, Square components (for each cell), and a Game component to manage the state.

## 3. Development Phase
### Basic React Concepts to Keep in Mind:

    State Management: Decide how you'll manage the game's state. The simplest approach might be to use React's useState hook within your Game component to track players' moves.
    Props: Use props to pass data and callback functions from parent components to child components. For example, your Board component can pass a function to each Square to handle clicks.

### Steps:

    Build the Board: Start with the Board component that renders 9 Square components.
    Implement Game Mechanics: Write the logic to check for a winner or a tie after each move. This can be a utility function that checks the game's state (an array representing the board's squares) for any winning combinations.
    Player Turns: Implement logic to alternate turns between two players (X and O).
    User Interaction: Handle user clicks on squares to make moves. Update the game's state accordingly, and re-render the board with the new state.
    Display Game Status: Show messages to indicate who's turn it is, the winner, or if there's a tie.

## 4. Styling

    CSS: Use CSS for styling your components. With React, you can use CSS modules or styled-components for component-specific styling.
    Responsive Design: Make sure your game looks good on different screen sizes.

## 5. Testing

    Unit Tests: Write tests for your components and game logic. React Testing Library and Jest are popular choices for testing React applications.
    Playtest: Manually test your game to ensure it works as expected.

## 6. Deployment

    Deployment: Use platforms like Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages to deploy your Tic Tac Toe game so others can play it online.

## Most Important Things to Keep in Mind

    Keep It Simple: Start with a basic version of your game. You can always add features, like the ability to play against an AI, later.
    Code Quality: Write clean, readable code. Use comments to describe complex logic.
    User Experience: Ensure the game is intuitive to use and visually appealing.
    Learn and Iterate: Use this project as a learning experience. Don't be afraid to refactor your code as you learn better ways to do things.
